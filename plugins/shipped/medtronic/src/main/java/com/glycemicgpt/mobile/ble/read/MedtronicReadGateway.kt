/*
 * GlycemicGPT code (GPL-3.0). Capability-facing read bundle for the Medtronic MiniMed 700-series
 * read-only driver.
 *
 * This is the Medtronic analog of Tandem's `TandemBleDriver`: a single seam the capability delegates
 * (MedtronicGlucoseSource / MedtronicInsulinSource / MedtronicPumpStatus) forward to, so the delegates
 * stay thin. It owns four cross-cutting concerns the individual C1/C2 readers deliberately left to
 * their caller (see MedtronicSessionReader's timeout contract):
 *   1. resolving the live SAKE session + the GATT-client transport, failing cleanly when not connected;
 *   2. bounding every read with a per-operation timeout (the readers carry no timers);
 *   3. serializing every read so no two exchanges overlap on the single one-exchange-at-a-time link
 *      (the polling orchestrator drives the fast/medium/slow tiers as independent coroutines, so this
 *      seam is where they coalesce into single-flight -- see [readMutex]);
 *   4. routing caught failures through Timber so they are observable in the glycemicgpt-mobile Sentry
 *      project once this runs in :app (Story AC7).
 *
 * It adds no parsing of its own -- the readers (CgmReader / IddStatusReader / HistoryReader /
 * DeviceInfoReader / BatteryReader) own that. READ-ONLY: only report/get-class reads are issued.
 *
 * **Transport seam.** The on-device `AndroidMedtronicGattLink` (a `BluetoothGatt` client to the
 * connected pump's CGM / IDD / Device-Info GATT server) implements [MedtronicGattLink] and is supplied
 * by the DI module's [linkProvider], which returns the link while a pump is `CONNECTED` and `null`
 * otherwise -- so reads report "not connected" rather than fabricate data when no pump is authenticated.
 * The link resolves the shared SIG `0x2A52` [MedtronicProtocol.RACP_UUID] under the CGM service for
 * [getCgmReading] and under the IDD service for [getHistoryLogs] (the readers reuse the same
 * characteristic UUID across both services). The link is strictly one-exchange-at-a-time; this gateway
 * owns the cross-exchange serialization (see [readMutex]).
