/**
 * The minimal GATT operations the read layer needs, abstracted so the readers and
 * [MedtronicSessionReader] are transport-agnostic and unit-testable against canned frames.
 *
 * In the inverted topology the pump connects to the phone (peripheral) but exposes its CGM / IDD /
 * Device-Info services as a GATT **server**; over that same link the phone acts as a GATT **client**
 * to read them — exactly as OpenMinimed's PythonPumpConnector does over BlueZ (write the control
 * point, subscribe for notifications, read static characteristics). The concrete Android
 * `BluetoothGatt`-client implementation of this interface is wired in Milestone C3; the connection
 * manager already owns the link and the post-handshake [com.glycemicgpt.mobile.ble.sake.MedtronicSakeSession].
 *
 * All payloads cross this seam as raw bytes; SAKE encryption/decryption is applied above it
 * ([MedtronicSessionReader]), and the 20-byte PDU cap is honored by fragmenting outbound writes via
 * [com.glycemicgpt.mobile.ble.protocol.PduFramer] and reassembling inbound notifications
 * ([NotificationReassembler]). Implementations never call `requestMtu()`.
 *
 * Per the project's BLE guideline, the implementation must time-bound every [read]/[write]/[subscribe]
 * operation (the C3 wiring enforces this); this interface defines no timer of its own.

     *
     * **Threading contract:** all [onPdu] callbacks across every subscribed characteristic are
     * delivered serialized on a single thread. [MedtronicSessionReader] relies on this to keep its
     * per-exchange state lock-free; the on-device implementation (Milestone D) must honor it (e.g. by
     * hopping BLE callbacks onto one handler thread, as the connection manager already does).
     *
     * **Cancellation/cleanup contract:** the caller bounds each exchange with an operation timeout and
     * cancels the coroutine on expiry, but a reader only calls [unsubscribe] when the pump *responds*.
     * The implementation MUST therefore release every outstanding subscription/notification when the
     * driving operation's coroutine is cancelled, so a timed-out read leaves no dangling notifications
     * that could desync the next exchange. See the matching "Cancellation/cleanup contract" /
     * `TODO(48.D)` on [MedtronicReadGateway] for the full semantics.
